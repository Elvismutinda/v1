# V1

This is my personal portfolio built with Next.js

### The portfolio is still in development!!!

## How To Run the App

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies

   ```
   npm install
    ```

   If you're using yarn:

   ```
   yarn install
   ```

    Packages (Run each on its own)

    ```
   npm install react-social-icons

   npm install framer-motion
   ```

   If you're using yarn, replace 'npm install' with 'yarn add'.

    More packages my be added in the future if I do updates.

3. Run the app

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   Or if you're using yarn:

   ```
   yarn dev
   ```
The app will then be accessed in your browser on `http://localhost:3000`
